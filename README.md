# 🌤️ Weather App

A **Flutter**-based weather application providing real-time weather information for **Lahore, Pakistan**. This app was created as part of my journey in learning Flutter, following the tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzRQ9mnmh44&t=57451s). It leverages the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/) to showcase current conditions, hourly forecasts, and additional weather details.
## 📱 Features

- **🌡️ Current Weather**: Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other key details for Lahore.
- **🕒 Hourly Forecast**: Shows upcoming hourly weather predictions.
- **ℹ️ Additional Information**: Displays pressure, wind speed, and more.
